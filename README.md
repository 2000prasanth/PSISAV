# Pedestrian Safety and Recognition System (PSISAV)

## Introduction
Autonomous vehicles, or self-driving cars, are transforming transportation with advanced technology to navigate without human input. This repository hosts the source code for a Pedestrian Safety and Recognition System (PSISAV) designed for these vehicles.

## Project Overview
PSISAV aims to enhance pedestrian safety for autonomous vehicles operating in urban environments. It includes modules for pedestrian detection and traffic sign recognition, ensuring safe coexistence with pedestrians.

## Key Features
- **Pedestrian Detection**: Detects pedestrians using computer vision algorithms.
- **Traffic Sign Recognition**: Recognizes traffic signs through deep learning models.
- **Safety-Centric Design**: Prioritizes pedestrian safety in vehicle decision-making.
- **Real-time Processing**: Offers real-time capabilities for autonomous systems.
- **Scalability**: Scales with the evolving complexity of autonomous technologies.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `main` script to start the PSISAV system.
4. Integrate PSISAV into your autonomous vehicle platform.
