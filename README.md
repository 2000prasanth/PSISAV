Autonomous Vehicle Pedestrian Safety and Recognition System
Autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving cars, have revolutionized transportation by employing cutting-edge technology to perceive their surroundings and navigate without human intervention. This GitHub repository contains the source code and resources for a Pedestrian Safety and Recognition System for autonomous vehicles.

Introduction
Autonomous vehicles leverage technologies such as artificial intelligence, computer vision, LIDAR, and GPS to assess their environment and make decisions autonomously. However, ensuring the safety of pedestrians is paramount for the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. Pedestrians are dynamic entities with diverse behaviors and characteristics, making their detection and recognition a complex task.

Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Pedestrian Safety and Recognition System (PSISAV) for autonomous vehicles. The system comprises modules designed to identify traffic safety signs and detect pedestrians in real-time. By prioritizing pedestrian safety in both operation and design, semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles can coexist safely with pedestrians in urban environments.

Key Features
Pedestrian Detection: Utilizes computer vision algorithms to detect pedestrians in various environmental conditions.
Traffic Sign Recognition: Implements deep learning models to recognize and interpret traffic safety signs.
Safety-Centric Design: Emphasizes pedestrian safety in the decision-making process of autonomous vehicles.
Real-time Processing: Provides real-time processing capabilities for seamless integration into autonomous vehicle systems.
Scalability: Designed to scale with the increasing complexity and demands of autonomous vehicle technology.
